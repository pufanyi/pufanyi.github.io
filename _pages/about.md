I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), specializing in [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-programme/bachelor-of-science-in-data-science-artificial-intelligence).

I am currently a [URECA](<https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-research-experience-on-campus-(ureca)>) student at [MMLab@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/). I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Ziwei Liu](https://liuziwei7.github.io/), I am also grateful for the extensive help I have received from [Bo Li](https://brianboli.com/). My research interests currently lie in large-scale multi-modality models.

During my time at [Shaoxing No.1 High School](http://www.sxyz.net/), I participated in the [Olympiad in Informatics](https://www.noi.cn/). Additionally, I competed in the [ICPC](https://icpc.global/) competition, where I earned a [gold medal](/assets/pdf/awards/Kunming.pdf) in the 2022 Kunming Asia Regional Contest and a [silver medal](/assets/pdf/awards/Nanjing.pdf) in the 2022 Nanjing Asia Regional Contest.
