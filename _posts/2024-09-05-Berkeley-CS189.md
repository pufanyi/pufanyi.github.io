## Lecture 1: Introduction and Logistics

### Some ideas

All modern machine learning algorithms are just nearest neighbors. It's only that the neural networks are telling you the space in which to compute the distance.

### Math Review

#### SVD

$$
A = U \Sigma V^\top=\sum_{i=1}^{\min\{m, n\}}\sigma_i u_i v_i^\top
$$

Compute largest $$k$$ singular values and vectors: $$\mathcal{O}(kmn)$$.
